## Overview

This project leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to provide a solution for:

1. Recognizing various food items from images.
2. Estimating the calorie content of identified food items.
3. Helping users monitor their dietary intake effectively.

The problem statement for this task is as follows:

> Develop a model that can accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content, enabling users to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices.

## Features

- **Food Image Recognition**: Identify different types of food items from images.
- **Calorie Estimation**: Provide approximate calorie values based on recognized food items.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Utilizes NVIDIA GPUs for faster training and inference.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: (Future Work) Build a mobile or web application for easy tracking.
- **Scalability**: Add support for new food items and regions.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow
- **Dataset Management**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Model Architecture**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- **Other Tools**: OpenCV, Matplotlib

## Data Requirements

- **Image Dataset**: The [Food-101 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101) containing 101,000 images of 101 food classes.
- **Nutritional Information**: Calorie content and nutritional value of food items.
- Data augmentation techniques to enhance dataset diversity.

### Dataset Setup

1. Download the [Food-101 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101).
2. Extract the dataset and organize it into training and validation folders.
3. Place the dataset in the `data/` directory of the project.

## Model Architecture

The model uses CNNs for feature extraction and classification. Key components include:

1. **Preprocessing**: Resize and normalize input images.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Leverages pre-trained models like InceptionV3 for transfer learning.
3. **Classification Layer**: Identifies the food item.
4. **Regression Layer**: Estimates calorie content.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-calorie-tracker.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd food-calorie-tracker
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Verify GPU availability (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.test.gpu_device_name())"
   ```
5. Prepare the dataset as described in the [Dataset Setup](#dataset-setup) section.

## Usage

1. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
2. Test the model with sample images:
   ```bash
   python test.py --image <path_to_image>
   ```
3. Use the calorie estimation feature:
   ```bash
   python calorie_estimator.py --image <path_to_image>
   ```
